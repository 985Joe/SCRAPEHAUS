	<div class="about-heading-underline"></div>
	<p class="about-p">“GABE GIZZ” Also known as “33 God” is a 26 year old Hip Hop / Alternative Hip Hop artist / producer currently residing in Rockford IL.<br><br>
		Born in Brixton (South London, UK) into a British-Nigerian household, Gabe has a unique voice and music style that can’t be compared to anyone else. Combining witty punchlines and infectious melodies, it’s clear that his music has been influenced by a wide range of artist and different genres.
		His sound is a clear reflection of the various rich cultures running through his veins.<br><br>
		
		Pop, Rap, Soul, Trap, Grime, etc..  Gabe can do it all. To put an artist this versatile into a box of any sort is an injustice.<br><br>
		
		With a total 8 projects put out over the last 8 years (#9 on the way) and countless singles, Gabe’s catalog is one no one should take lightly. Gabe first appeared on the scene with his first mixtape dating back to Feb 2012 titled “Dreams and Insomnia” a rap heavy mixtape which displayed his witty, hard hitting punchline ability and deep 90’s era hip hop roots. Scary part is, GABE has only gotten better with time. As of late, he has started to self produce all his own music!<br><br>
		
		Through-out the last 8 years, the “33 God” keeps on pushing the envelope and transcending barriers through his music by working with various artist and doing shows all over the world. Pushing the Global  “SCRAPE”, “SCRAPERGANG” Agenda, Gabe Gizz, a key pillar of this movement, is alongside a group of young creatives with intent to impact EVERY aspect of the culture. The “SCRAPERGANG” collective of writers, recording artist, producers, engineers, cinematographers, clothing designers, and graphic designers, are reminiscent to a new age ASAP MOB, Gabe being the Asap Rocky, or leader of this talented coalition.<br><br>
		
		A Father, a big brother, a friend, Gabe’s music is just a small portion of a very big picture.
		With goals to become a world renowned philanthropist, music is just a way in the door. Gabe integrates a self help undertone throughout his efforts which provides fans a reciprocated support system. A “Be the best you can be” or a “You can do it too” attitude, which lifts and inspires listeners to go out and follow their dreams too, just like He has done with his own life.<br><br>
		
		“Its more than music… Struggles. Create. Really. Awesome. People. Everywhere. That is what we believe.<br><br>
		Striving. Creating. Reaching. Absolute. Potential. EVERYDAY is our mission. These are the principals that “SCRAPE” stands on.<br><br>
		
		ALMIGHTY-SCRAPERGANG-SCUMBAGMAFIAWORLDWIDE (SCRAPERGANG) will take the world by storm. So on the look out for Gabe Gizz and Co. and all their creative efforts.  You can plan on seeing Gabe compete on the biggest stage, going head to head with some of the worlds biggest and renowned artists. Are you ready?<br><br>
		
		SCRAPE </p>
